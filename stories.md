# Prologue

# Ok, only three more miles to walk through this blizzard until I reach the time machine. DANG IT!!! The GPS went down. Fortunately, I know the way. This snow is five feet thick! Good thing I have boots with a two feet radius. Ok, we are here, the bunker. It looks like an outhouse with a solar panel But don’t be fooled!  This place is a wasteland. I wish that the Antarctic was warmer. [access granted]. Boy that blizzard felt like the world was in a giant freezer!    

# There is a poster that contains information about how time travel works. Underneath that poster is a door that has a sign above it which says, “to Doctor,” the person that hired me. To the left of that door there is a metal box that is a time machine! I head to the time machine. I set the time to 1898 April first 12:30 pm. I look down and I a red button that says “time” to go! I slam it down and faint. 30 minutes later I wake up and look outside I am in Cuba 1898 April first 12:30 pm “last chance to not get involved in this war” I think. Then I run to the nearest military base and I warn the Spanish that the Americans that are coming to war. Before I enter, I see large metal gate that looks like an iron version of Superman’s fortress of Solitude.

# Chapter 1: time of war

# “last chance to not get involved in this war” I think. Then I run to the nearest military base and I warn the Spanish that the Americans that are coming to war. Before I enter, I see large metal gate that looks like an iron version of Superman’s fortress of Solitude.  

# {flashback}

# I see a man; he calls himself Doctor. I can tell that he had power once, but he lost it. He is the one who brought me here.  “Do you know why I brought you here?” said Doctor.   “No,” I say.  He says in a voice that’s like a chain being dragged across the floor, “I need you to do some tests for me.”  “Why did you hire me and not do it yourself?” I say sternly. “Because these tests are too dangerous and, I’m too important,” said Doctor. “how much will you pay me?” I ask.   Doctor replies, “50 grand per test.” “What is the first test?” I ask. Doctor replies, “in the Spanish American war make the Spanish win.”

# {end flashback} 4/21/1898 start of the Spanish American war

# Last night I told the Spanish about a secret of something that would not be discovered for ages, the secret of a nuclear bomb. The Spanish go crazy like a cat that is in front of tasty wet food with mining operations and recruit 129 men to find uranium but, they only have so much time before the Americans come.  

# Tink!... Tink!... Tink!... Tink!... Tink!... The sounds of mining, I think. Then I hear a miner shout, “uranium deposit!” After that I hear the boom of a cannon that sounds like a lightning strike and then, I see a flag raise, the American flag. Everyone starts screaming and shouting. They're all yelling, “The Americans have found the mining operations!” I franticly look around searching for items I can help the Spanish snag.  I trip on a rock. When I fall and then get up, I see a small plutonium deposit. it looks like a brown ball stuck in a rock. Just what I need to get home! I grab a nearby shovel, and I start digging. I notice an old rifle is pointed at me! I barely get the plutonium out before the person is ready to shoot.   

# Every Spanish person ran over to the military trucks to escape the Americans. We started the trucks as fast as we could. sadly only 3 fourths survived the attack and half of the remaining got wounded.





# CHAPTER 2: TESTING, TESTING 123 bomber   

# the infirmaries are overloaded with the wounded. It is a very grim sight especially for those who have had their family members wounded. People weeping over their brothers, their sisters, their mothers and their fathers. I see all this sadness and despair through the infirmary window. It makes me think about were my family went.

# “Lieutenant! captain wants you in his office,” says a young boy who is delivering messages.  

# I walk over to the captain’s office. I open the door. Captain is looking over the designs for the bomb. He says, “this bomb is too dangerous and too powerful to play with.” “That is why we need to use it!” I reply. He turns around.  He has a large cut down his right eye, it is partially bandaged. The bandage is half torn off.  



# He says “it’s the effects. Their inhuman!” “do you know the effects?” I ask. “yes, one of my soldiers overheard you muttering in your sleep.” he replies.  I look at him Strange. He says “no, I did not ask them to watch over you. He simply overheard you when he was going to bed” “captain!” a young man yells “the bomb’s ready for launch!”  

# We run over to the hanger.  I see a nuke is strapped to a plane! (It looks like a pregnant plane.)  



# Since this report is being told past-tense I can tell you there was a traitor in our mist! ----traitor’s view---- “The new base is near Havana port so they can destroy us.” “Well, we now can stop their plans and destroy the Spanish and take Cuba!” says captain. “NOW GO!” ---my view----



# “When can we destroy Havana port?”  I hopefully ask captain. “Four days, four days until launch,” he replies.   

# (three days and twenty-two hours later)  

# People are running around trying to get the bomb ready and the plane it is strapped to. People are yelling Questions like: “Is the plane fueled up?”  “Are the defenses ready?” and “Do you want more water?” “Ewwwww! is that what I think it is?” we are all very fanatic because one mistake and we’re desegregated in thin air!
